The big blue bird sat on the green tree. He sang a happy song. The sun was hot and bright. A small cat saw the bird. The cat wanted to play. But the bird flew away. The cat was sad. Then the cat found a red ball. The cat played with the ball all day long. It was a very good day. The grass was soft and wet. The cat jumped up and down. A yellow dog came to see the cat. They ran in the sun. The bird came back to the tree. He sang more songs. The cat and the dog listened to the music. They were all very happy in the big garden. The wind was cool. The flowers were pretty and red. It was a fun time for everyone.
